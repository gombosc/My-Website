<h2>Who am I?</h2>
Wait! Let me check one of those motivation letters that we've all written one too many times now. One of those that you always start by presenting yourself,
write a couple of nice things about your life, achievements and dreams, then move on to the actual reason your writing the letter in the first place. What do people usually
say about themselves? What makes us actually stand out from the crowd? I don't really know the answer to those question but I can tell you a bit about myself.
 
<h3>Origins</h3>

If you somehow missed it, my name is Cosmin. At the moment I'm a 24 years old master student at the University of Vienna,
studying Applied Economics, with a focus on finance and behavioral economics. At the same time, I'm a student at
42 Vienna, where I study computer science and wrestle with C on a daily basis. I've started legitimately programming
at the beginning of 2023, with a focus on Web Development, following a course from Andrei Neagoie. I did have some previous
knowledge of C and Python before that.

Besides that, for the last couple of months I've been part of the digital iLab, an innovation and entrepreneurship program, where together with my team, we struggle with the unbelievable
fun process of creating a startup.

Before all that, I lived in Romania and dabbled with digital marketing, e-commerce and startups. 

I studied International Business and Economics at FSEGA in Cluj-Napoca, as well as Civil Engineering at the University of Oradea.
