<h1>Who am I?</h1>
Hold on! Let me take a look at one of those motivation letters that we've all written one too many times.
You know the ones â€“ they ones that begin with a self-introduction, followed by a few flattering remarks about your life, achievements, and dreams,
before finally circling back to the real reason for writing.

So, let me introduce myself! My name is Cosmin, a 24-year-old master's student at the <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/en/">University of Vienna</a>, focusing on Finance and Behavioral Economics within Applied Economics.  In parallel, I'm a student at <a href="https://www.42vienna.com/">42 Vienna</a>, where I wrestle with C on a daily basis as I delve deeper into computer science. While Web Development is my current focus, my programming journey began in early 2023 with a <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/courses/coding-bootcamp/">course</a> from Andrei Neagoie, building on my previous programming foundation. Currently I'm actively exploring the potential of AR, VR, Fintech, and AI. 

Beyond academics, I've recently joined the <a href="https://ilabs.univie.ac.at/">digital iLab</a>, an innovation and entrepreneurship program. There, alongside with my team, we're embracing the challenge of building a startup. This adds to my prior explorations in digital marketing, e-commerce, business and the startup world.

As for my previous academic background, that is a blend of business and technical skills. I earned a degree in International Business and Economics from FSEGA in Cluj-Napoca, and one in Civil Engineering from the University of Oradea.
Since turning 18, I've immersed myself in the digital world. This entrepreneurial spirit led me to launch a few startups and explore digital marketing for several years. I then leveraged my technical skills by working as a SEO Engineer for a US multinational (Yardi), for one year.

Following the pandemic, I decided to take a gap year. During this time, I traveled a bit, embarked on a new journey of self-discovery and found a couple of new passions, such as programming, playing guitar, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or piloting. Afterwards, I've decided to tackle on a new challenge and move to a new country, Vienna.
