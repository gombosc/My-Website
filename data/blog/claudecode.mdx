I currently use Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Pro for almost everything.

I rely on Gemini for searching and learning, especially when combined with NotebookLLM, and VEO 3, which is remarkablyreally good (well not better as Midjourney but hey)

Even for coding basic UI designs and working prototypes, Gemini 2.5 Pro works excellent (depending on complexity, of course). For actual programming, however, I use Claude, and I recently upgraded to the Pro version. This kind of blew my mind a bit. 

For context, I switched from VS Code to Cursor about six months ago after a friend's persistent nagging. While I found Cursor mindblowing compared to the traditional experience, recent subscription updates have made it feel more expensive, more limited. Some users might want access to all models, but I only need to use two or three that I already have without fearing I might end up overpaying. This could have been particularly problematic for Claude Opus access.

I researched options for the most productive and cost-efficient setup, as a true capitalist. I wanted to work in my preferred IDE without being limited by Cursor's subscription model. Surfing the web and abstract forums, I discovered Windsurf, but haven't thoroughly tested it yet. From what I've read and seen, it sounds promising and potentially better than Claude (for more pretentious developers, that don’t write their code in Vim).

However, I found my solution before trying Windsurf: **Claude Code.**

One terminal command and you’re good to go. No way its that easy. it is. wow

```𝗻𝗽𝗺 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹 -𝗴 @𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰-𝗮𝗶/𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗲-𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲```

So I opened Cursor and tried it out, expecting numerous problems with it not running properly. To my surprise, it worked flawlessly on the first attempt. I was genuinely amazed, my jaw literally dropped. 

It's clean, simple, and runs directly in your terminal. You don't have to switch to another IDE, you don't need any plugins, nothing extra, nothing too fancy. It just works beautifully.

I initially worried about the token limit. I thought I'd quickly exhaust it and have to pay extra. To my surprise, it's included in individual pro plans at no additional cost. I was so amazed that I had to verify this by writing code in my terminal to explain it to me. It even retrieved Anthropic's documentation for confirmation. Thanks Claude, you're my best bud now.

I have been working with my new best buddy for a while now, and I might understand why many companies are making layoffs. While it can't replace a good developer with experience and systems thinking, it can free up considerable time for focusing on more creative aspects rather than wasting hours hunting for a misplaced comma in a codebase with 100k+ lines. It is not fair, but sometimes we have to let go of our old habits and adapt to a world that is ever changing. 

For me personally, I started coding on the web because it felt more creative and accessible than other programming areas. I never enjoyed using VIM or spending hours solving algorithm problems. I simply wanted to bring my ideas to life and have fun along the way. And now it really feels fun to code, to play around, to experiment, to build and make stuff. It is really fun!

Regarding the negativity surrounding AI, I believe it can be truly amazing, just like every other transformative technology. Being able to speak with my parents and girlfriend when I'm countries away still feels magical, similar to when I started my Xbox 360 for the first time on a snowy Christmas day many many years ago. Thanks Microsoft!

Through the help of these tools, we can start focusing more on what we love, and solve the problems that we want to solve. Technology really does feel like magic nowadays.
