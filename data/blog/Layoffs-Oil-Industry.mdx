## Layoff Trends Across the Industry

The energy sector has been experiencing job losses since the start of the year. This trend gained significant momentum in February with major layoff announcements from companies like Chevron. Chevron aims to reduce costs by **2 billion to 3 billion** by 2027. To achieve this, the company plans to reduce its global workforce by 15% to 20% by the end of 2026, impacting an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 employees. BP has also embarked on a cost-cutting initiative, resulting in the elimination of 4,700 jobs and a further reduction of 3,000 contractor positions.

These layoff announcements reflect a broader trend within the oil and gas industry. Shell, another industry giant, is reportedly planning to cut 20% of its workforce in its exploration and development divisions. These cuts are part of a larger trend of workforce reductions across various sectors, including technology, finance, and aviation.

## Factors Driving the Layoffs

### Economic Uncertainty

The global economy is facing a period of uncertainty, with high inflation, rising interest rates, and potential slowdowns impacting corporate profitability. In response, companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, including job cuts, to preserve cash flow and maintain competitiveness.

### Energy Transition

The ongoing transition towards cleaner energy sources is putting pressure on traditional oil and gas companies. As governments and consumers prioritize renewable energy and decarbonization, demand for fossil fuels may decline, impacting the profitability and long-term viability of oil and gas operations. Climate change and energy transition agendas are also playing a role in this shift.

### Technological Advancements

Advancements in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming industries, including oil and gas. Automation is leading to increased efficiency and productivity, which in turn reduces the need for human labor.

While these technologies offer opportunities to improve efficiency, they also raise concerns about potential job displacement. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that millions of jobs in traditional energy roles could be eliminated by 2030 due to advancements in digital technologies. This changing landscape requires companies to invest in digital capabilities and reskill their workforce to adapt to the new demands of the industry.

### Geopolitical Events

Geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict in the Middle East, can disrupt oil supplies and create uncertainty in the market. This volatility can impact investment decisions and potentially lead to job cuts as companies adjust to changing market dynamics. The policies of the new US administration are also expected to have a significant impact on the industry.

### Company-Specific Factors

Companies may undertake restructuring initiatives to streamline operations, optimize efficiency, and adapt to changing market conditions1. These restructuring efforts can involve job cuts as companies reorganize, consolidate departments, or exit unprofitable business lines1. In some cases, declining reserves and production challenges can also contribute to financial pressures and layoff decisions10.

### Other Contributing Factors:

- **Declining oil prices:** Geopolitical tensions and global market fluctuations have contributed to a decline in oil prices, impacting the financial performance of oil and gas companies.

- **Shareholder pressure:** Shareholders are increasingly concerned about the impact of green policies on profits, pushing companies to prioritize cost-cutting measures and higher return.

- **Competition from US rivals:** Some companies, like Shell, are aiming to reduce their workforce to match the employee count and cost-cutting methods of their US competitors.

## Strategies Employed by Companies

In response to the challenges driving layoffs, oil and gas companies are employing various strategies:

**Restructuring and reorganization:** Companies are simplifying organizational structures, centralizing operations, and streamlining processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs15. This can involve consolidating departments, eliminating redundancies, and redefining roles to optimize workforce utilization1.

**Cost-cutting measures:** Beyond layoffs, companies are implementing broader cost reduction programs to improve profitability and competitiveness10. This can include reducing capital expenditures, optimizing operational expenses, and renegotiating contracts to lower overall costs16. Companies like Shell are selling non-core assets, such as refineries and pipelines, to generate cash and focus on higher-margin operations.

**Investment in new technologies and renewable energy:** Recognizing the long-term shift towards cleaner energy, some companies are investing in renewable energy sources, carbon capture technologies, and other low-carbon solutions17. This diversification can help mitigate the risks associated with declining fossil fuel demand and position companies for a sustainable future17. BP, for example, plans to invest in digital capabilities, especially AI and automation, to enhance efficiency and competitiveness.

**Mergers and acquisitions:** The industry is witnessing a wave of mergers and acquisitions as companies seek to consolidate operations, gain access to new resources, and enhance market share18. While mergers can create synergies and improve efficiency, they can also lead to job cuts as companies eliminate redundancies and streamline operations19. ExxonMobil's layoff announcement, for example, is a direct result of its merger with Pioneer Natural Resources5. Mergers and acquisitions can also decrease firm value due to the loss of human capital and expertise.

 **Talent retention and development programs:** Companies are focusing on retaining skilled workers and developing talent to navigate the changing industry landscape20. This can involve offering competitive compensation packages, providing opportunities for career development, and investing in training programs to upskill employees and prepare them for future challenges21.

In summary, amidst a challenging market for renewable fuels and underperforming margins, Neste is undertaking aggressive cost-saving actions—including cutting 600 jobs and revising its dividend policy—as part of its turnaround strategy

## Potential Impact and Future Outlook

The layoffs in the oil and gas industry have the potential to significantly impact both the industry itself and the broader economy.

### Impact on the Industry

Layoffs can lead to a loss of skilled workers and expertise, potentially hindering innovation and growth within the industry. Companies may face challenges in attracting and retaining talent, especially as the energy transition creates new opportunities in renewable energy and clean technology sectors. This "brain drain" to the renewable energy sector could exacerbate existing talent shortages within oil and gas.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that clean energy sectors have added more jobs globally than fossil fuels in recent years, highlighting the shifting employment landscape within the energy industry. This trend, coupled with the increasing use of technology and automation, could lead to a "jobless recovery" in the oil and gas industry, where companies prioritize efficiency and automation over hiring new workers.

The geographic concentration of oil and gas jobs and the mismatch between fossil fuel job locations and renewable energy job locations pose challenges for a smooth workforce transition34. Workers in remote oil and gas producing regions may find it difficult to relocate or transition to jobs in the renewable energy sector, which are often concentrated in different geographic areas.
