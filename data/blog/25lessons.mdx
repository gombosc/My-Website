> Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity. And so we ask ourselves: will our actions echo across the centuries? Will strangers hear our names long after we are gone and wonder who we were, how bravely we fought, how fiercely we loved - Troy (2004)

Turning 25 is strange, so I've decided to reflect and write down 25 lessons I've learned so far. These insights come from my personal experience and are more meant to be a reminder of how our perspective changes across the years rather than rigid rules to the dynamic environment that shapes our life.

# 1) You will fail, and that’s okay

When we leave our parents' home, we expect the world to bow at our feet. We venture out, seeking fame, success, and never-ending glory. More often than not, though, we fail miserably. Sometimes harder, sometimes lighter, but almost certainly, we fail.

Some roads lead to dead ends, and that's infuriating, and frightening. Sometimes, no matter what we try, nothing seems to work. You start feeling like a failure; desperation rises, self-doubt and disappointment haunt your nights. When the world feels overwhelming, take a step back, look around, and find another road.

Don't despair—failure is your best teacher.

# 2) Growth requires sacrifices

To grow, you must make sacrifices and give something in return. The journey will be challenging, but you must maintain faith in yourself and your actions, even when others lose belief in you. If it's truly what you desire, stay true to yourself and follow your path.

# 3) Discipline and focus are the keys to progress

Remove the background noise, work towards your dreams. Motivation fades away, discipline endures. Do what you say you'll do, avoid excuses, be the hero of your own story. If you truly want to achieve something, learn to focus and stick with it, even when you don't feel like it. Progress is made step by step, day by day. Achieving dreams is like running a marathon—you cross the finish line mile by mile. You'll never reach that goal if you don't move towards it steadily, or if you sprint at the start and exhaust yourself early.

Be brave enough to listen to your heart, or be brave enough to face the consequences of not doing so. It's your life - follow your heart.

# 4) Meditate

It's a cliché, but it's true. Learn to make peace with your mind, whether through sitting and following your breath, practicing yoga, running, cycling, or any other method. Meditation is about finding harmony with your thoughts, calming your mind, and learning to ride the waves rather than drowning in them. Quieting your mind puts everything into perspective, bringing peace and clarity— along with numerous other benefits. Find the practice that suits you best and commit to it.

Remember, just as going to the gym once or twice a week yields slow results, meditation requires consistent practice. Keep at it, even when your mind resists.

# 5) Workout

Staying active through regular exercise and physical activities benefits both your physical and mental health. Find a sport you enjoy and stick with it—it will support you throughout all stages of your life.

# 6) Challenge yourself

Challenges test our limits and reveal our true potential. We often create mental barriers, confining ourselves within self-imposed boundaries. Our minds define these limits, keeping us from realizing our full capabilities. To break free from these limitations, we must challenge ourselves. Whether intellectual or physical, these challenges teach us lessons about who we are, what we're capable of, and how far we can go through sheer willpower.

# 7) Reading is important

In a world dominated by fast content, reading brings us back to a quieter world. It requires us to pause, take our time, and engage page by page, allowing our imagination to flourish. Reading enables us to explore complex ideas and stories deeply. Amid constant distractions, it offers a much-needed break from the noise of the modern world, letting our minds wander. When cultivated, it l can enrich our lives in countless ways.

# 8) People come and go

You’ll meet amazing people, you’ll share special moments, things will happen, time will past, some people will leave, or you might be the one to leave . Occasionally, you’ll meet certain people with whom you will connect deeply. But even these connections may be temporary. Appreciate each moment and let things unfold naturally.

# 9) Whatever happens, happens

Change what you can, accept what you can't. Life moves on; everything ends eventually, be it good or bad. Gaze at the star-filled night sky—we have precious little time on this earth to worry to much. Your biggest problem now might become a funny story in a few years. Don't take things too seriously; everything passes in the end.

# 10) Don’t judge others easily

We often categorize people based on our previous experiences, putting them in neat little boxes. While we might occasionally be right, more often than not, we're wrong. We fail to see the stories behind the people in front of us—their past, their choices—yet we still judge them. We judge based on status, race, appearance, style, or whatever catches our eye. We judge so much that we forget to listen to those around us. Give people a chance, listen to their stories, be kind. We don't know what someone might be going through; sometimes, a simple smile and compliment can change somebody's day.

# 11) If nothing changes, then nothing changes

“If you keep doing what you're doing, you're going to keep getting what you're getting. “

If you want something to change in your life, go and make that change. Waiting for something to happen to you is like waiting for the perfect girl to show up at your front door, asking you to marry her. Go and chase your dreams - life won’t wait for you. Trains come and go, you must start your journey at some point, else you will be in the same position as you’ve always been. Whether good or bad, things will happen, life will change, and you'll evolve. Don't passively wait for life to unfold; make it happen.

# 12) Hate breeds hate, be kind

It's a vicious cycle—move beyond it. Revenge won't make you feel better, and violence won't solve your issues. Instead, focus on healing, understanding, and finding constructive ways to address conflicts. Everyone needs just a bit of kindness. Don't react to hate or spread it—nothing good ever comes from it. Be kind to people; you'll be surprised by the outcome. 

# 13) Question your beliefs

Don't blindly accept everything you hear—question and research. Read widely, experience life, and form your own opinions. 

The Internet isn't as reliable as it once was. News outlets don't always portray the true story, politicians often bend the truth, and social media is a poor source for learning. Misinformation and disinformation spread like wildfire, deepfakes are increasingly difficult to spot, and truth gets lost in a sea of content. Form your own opinions and seek the truth where possible. 

# 14) Even the darkest of nights ends

Some days will suck, some weeks will drag on endlessly, some months will turn your life upside down, and some years will make you question everything. But remember, everything passes. The sun will rise again, even when it seems impossible.

# 15) Follow your heart, even when it’s frightening to do so

We might get lost from time to time, straying away from our path and our dreams. Take some time off, sit with yourself, and listen to your heart—it knows the answer even when you might not. Be 

# 16) Time is our most important asset

We need to choose wisely how we spend our time and with whom we spend it with. While young, time seems abundant. Gradually, it becomes a scarce resource. You'll hear people say, "I'm sorry, but I don't have any free time," or "I wish I could do that, but I just don't have enough time." Sometimes we're genuinely busy, but often we choose to waste our time instead of cultivating it. Identifying what's important to us helps us understand how to spend our time more wisely.

There's an opportunity cost for everything—we just have to decide what's meaningful to us.

# 17) Be at the same level of your expectations

This is a tough lesson, as most of us face it frequently. Before judging others or expecting them to behave a certain way, we should take a hard look at ourselves the mirror. Ask yourself if you're living up to the standards you set for others. Do not try to change others; focus on changing yourself. If you want to help others, start by improving yourself and then lead by example. Remember, some people don't want to change, some can't, and some just need time. Let things unfold naturally, do your best, and stay true to yourself.

# 18) Trust people based on their actions, not their words

Words are cheap; actions require time and effort. Don't be fooled by charming smiles and empty promises. Often, those who talk the least accomplish the most. Choose your words carefully—don't make promises you can't keep or commitments you won't honor.

# 19) Break your patterns

We tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. Our lives are guided by patterns that, if left unrecognized, leave us repeating the same mistakes, getting the same results. We have to understand the patterns that hold us back and that drives us to repeat the same actions. 

Writing is a powerful tool for introspection. Unlike our memories, which we often unconsciously alter, words on paper remain unchanged. This permanence allows for deeper self-reflection and understanding of our patterns.

# 20) Life’s unfair

It's that simple: the sooner you accept life's unfairness, the sooner you can make the best of what you have. Complaining gets you nowhere, and making excuses keeps you stuck. Don't play the victim or expect the world to owe you anything—because it doesn't. No one's coming on a white horse to rescue you from yourself. You've got to fight for what you want.

# 21) The only certainty in life is death

It's another cliché, but one we often forget: death is our only certainty. We should use this knowledge as a guideline for living better, more fulfilling lives. Putting our lives into perspective against death forces us to rethink our priorities and how we decide to spend our time. Contemplating our mortality helps us see things more clearly, to take risks. A simple exercise is to imagine ourselves on our deathbed, looking back on how we've lived. Would we be proud of the way we've lived and the person we've been? Time passes quickly—better to make the most of it while we're still alive. So go get that girl, move to that country, buy that motorcycle.

# 22) Life is better surrounded by people

The Harvard Study of Adult Development, also known as the Grant Study, has been ongoing for over 85 years. Conducted by Harvard Medical School, it examines individuals' lives to determine what constitutes a good life. The study's key finding is:

> Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives.

That’s it, now go call a friend. 

# 23) If you decide to love, love deeply

Relationships and love are integral parts of our lives, taking up most of our time alongside work and hobbies. When we choose to love, we should embrace it fully and deeply. We ought to be present and cherish every moment with those we love, while they're still with us.

# 24) Finding your life passion is harder than expected

Some of us discover our passion early in life, while others struggle to find it. Keep exploring and trying new things until you uncover what you truly love. As Steve Jobs famously said, the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

It's a challenging journey, but since work occupies most of our lives, it's crucial for us to find something we deeply care about.

# 25) People, Passion and Love

Surround yourself with the right people, work passionately, and love deeply. These three principles are my current guidelines for a fulfilling life. Remember that life is short, that one day you will die, and that your choices define you . Embrace this knowledge and live life to its fullest.
