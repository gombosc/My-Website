I recently started reading a new book about history called "100 Mistakes that Changed History" by Bill Fawcett. The book covers a range of historical events involving figures like Darius I, Alexander The Great, Julius Caesar, Erik the Red, and many others. The stories underline how our choices shape history and how we continually repeat past mistakes.

For me, the book makes for a better way to kill my time while traveling across the city in the Viennese metros than checking the last memes sent by my friends, or the latest tweet by Elon Musk. One story, in particular, caught my attention yesterday. It was perhaps the combination of Vikings, violent battles, and family drama that made it stand out for me.

This story is set around the year 1000 and it involves Erik The Red (or the Bloody), and two of his children, Leif and Freydis.

<h1>Erik the Red - The Bloody Explorer</h1>

Erik Thorvaldsson, also known as Erik the Red due to his fiery hair, short temper and violent deeds, was born in Norway around 950 AD. He had to flee Norway due to his father's involvement in a manslaughter case, after which Erik's family settled in Iceland. There, Erik's own violent temper led to his banishment after a series of feuds and killings. His search for a new home took him westward, towards Greenland, which he discovered around 982 AD. He established the first settlement there and named the land ‘Greenland’, despite the reality of the harsh and icy environment. Erik’s effort did payoff though, and by 986 AD he had established two colonies out there, which thrived for several centuries.

<h1>Leif Erikson: The First European in America </h1> 

Leif Erikson, one of Erik’s sons, inherited his father's adventurous spirit. Around 1000 AD, inspired by the tales told by another Norseman, Bjarni Herjólfsson, Leif embarked on a voyage to discover and explore uncharted territories situated more to the west. He and his crew landed on the shores of a new land after quite a short trip, a land full of wild grapes and green pastures. Leif named this place Vinland and built a small settlement which is now known as the first known European settlement in North America, predating Christopher Columbus by nearly 500 years. 

Leif's success in Vinland sparked further interest among the Norse, leading to additional expeditions, including those involving his siblings. Among them, Freydis Eiriksdottir stands out for her notorious actions that would eventually lead to her downfall, as well as bringing an end to the Vinland chapter.

<h1>Freydis Eiriksdottir: The Fierce and Controversial</h1>

Freydis, another of Erik's children, is a figure shrouded in controversy. Accounts of her character and deeds vary, but she is generally depicted as bold and determined woman, with a violent temper similar to her fathers.

In a notable expedition, Freydis joined a group of settlers led by Thorfinn Karlsefni, aiming to establish a permanent colony in Vinland. Despite initial successes, tensions rose between the settlers and the indigenous people. According to the sagas, Freydis played a critical role in repelling an attack, showing remarkable courage while holding the indigenous people back until the boats were ready to launch. She emerged as a heroic figure and returned home safely. Shortly after their return to Greenland, Erik the Red passed away, and Leif became the next ruler.

<h1>Freydis's Rage</h1>
During a later voyage, a larger group was formed and more ships set sail westward. Despite setting out together, the ships traveled at different speeds, resulting in some reaching their destination sooner than others. Unfortunately for Helgi and Finnbogi, two Viking leaders, their ship arrived before Freydis's. According to Viking tradition, in unoccupied lands, those who arrived first had the privilege of choosing their preferred houses. This posed a problem for Freydis, the previous hero who had fought against the indigenous people during the last expedition, as she arrived later. Freydis was not only a hero but also the sister of King Leif. This connection led to a further conflict between her and the two Vikings who had settled in the nicer stone houses. Despite Freydis's warnings, they refused to leave, citing the law as their protection. It is said that Freydis, in a fit of rage, killed both men and seized control of the house. However, Freydis didn't stop there. Consumed by her anger, she commanded the execution of the men's families, including the women and children. According to the legend, when her men refused to carry out the order, she took an axe and committed the act herself. Even in the violent Norse culture, killing women and children was a crime punishable by death.

<h1>Freydis's Exile</h1>

Upon Freydis and the group's return to Greenland, Leif faced a difficult situation. His sister, Freydis, was technically guilty of murder under the law, having killed women and children from her own tribe. Word of her actions had spread, resulting in outrage and scandal. The situation was further complicated by a Viking law prohibiting the killing of family members. To avoid further scandal, Leif chose to banish Freydis from Greenland and forbade his people from returning to Vinland. This marked the last Viking journey to Vinland, with the land only being rediscovered by Spanish explorers five centuries later.

In many ways, Freydis's choices and actions reflect the capricious nature of history. Her courage and ferocity were instrumental in the Norsemen's early successes in Vinland, but her violent temper and ruthless actions ultimately led to her exile. If she have had kept her composure back then, maybe the Norse could have continued to explore Vinland, fundamentally altering the course of history. Instead, their chapter in America's history ended prematurely, leaving Spain to make the next major discovery. This could be a reminder on the profound impact of individual choices, reminding us that history is not just shaped by grand events and powerful rulers, but also by personal actions and decisions. The Vikings may have been the first to explore America, but it was Freydis's choices that decided their fate there.
